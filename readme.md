# Ironhack Final Project
By Amy Davies, Carolina Romanos, David Guardia and Snehith Reddy.

**Introduction**

Our app is based on the popular restaurant table-booking app "El Tenedor". We have made an app that allows users to search for restaurants by name, food type and ambience, make reservations, leave reviews and edit their details. For businesses they can also create a seperate account in order to promote their business. They can acceot or decline reservations and update their informtion.

**Description**

The first page which loads is a list of all restaurants with a search bar at the top of the page. The search bar can be utilised to search 3 different types of criteria. The bottom nav bar is only for logged in users, so if a guest clicks on it, they will be redirected to the login page. Once logged in, a user can leave reviews and make reservations. For reservations, the user can choose a time, date, number of people at their own convenience and they can navigate the status of that reservation, but clicking on the reservation button on the bottom navbar. There are three status'; pending, accepted and declined. 

For business users, they can upload images of their restaurant, which will be displayed in a carousel at the top of the page. They can also add their address, restaurant type, food type, opening times and a description. As well as that, they can also add menu items and prices so users can see what dishes they offer.

**Technologies Used**

For this project we have used:

- React
- React-Dates
- React-Slick (to assemble the carousel model)
- Slick-Carousel (CSS code to style the carousel)
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS ( We used the BEM method)
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary
- Express

**Challenges and Future Plans**

Challenges:

- We were overly ambitious with what we could achieve in 8 days! We were not able to implement all of the ideas that we had for the app.
- Handling the business information was challenging, the model is very complicated and handling data took some time to figure out.
- The search bar was difficult to implement as we wanted the user to be able to search using 3 seperate parameters, which we did achieve.

Future Plans:

- Users will be able to make a food order which will go directly to the restaurant.
- Restaurants can reply to comments.
